# Project Name

## Description

This project is a small React application that interacts with a .NET 8 backend API. The application utilizes fake data to simulate flight information. The front end is built with React, while the backend is developed using .NET 8.

## Instructions

1) Run both of the projects at the same time.
2) Be sure to use port 5000 for the backend project and port 5173 for the frontend project
3) Use the following flight info to test the functionality: \
DepartureAirline = EVA Air \
ArrivalAirline = China Airlines \
DepartureDate = 10-04-2024 \
Return Date =  10-04-2024 \
This is due to most seed data being created with this parameters (Rest of the seed data can be found in the controller in the .net project.
